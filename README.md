# SMS Assistant

1. Create Twilio account / API keys
2. Serverless API to receive SMS webhooks (so a lambda function can be triggered that responds)
3. A DB to map phone numbers to `instance_id`s

### To Deploy
- Have AWS SAM configured: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
